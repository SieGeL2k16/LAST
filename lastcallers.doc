  WARNING: THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY USABLE IF YOU ARE RUNNING F.A.M.E. ! IT'S NOT
           AMIEX - COMPATIBLE ! IF YOU USING AMIEX, PLEASE USE S-AMILOG BY
           P0T-NOoDLE of ANTHROX, aS tHIS IS THE BEST LASTCALLER-UTIL EVER
           WRITTEN FOR AMIEX & AND MOST OF THE DESIGN OF MY LASTCALLERS IS
           TAKEN FROM S-AMILOG..:)

1.General
~~~~~~~~~

- Very very fast updating (ca. 1 sec.!) - but again only C-Code...

- Stores 20 Users in a datafile, allowing you to show max. 20 Users :)

- Makes some bulletins for the best records (not implemented yet!)

- Supports Telnet/Internet Connects

- Supports special logfile for SysOps

- V0.60 or higher versions support now also X2 Modem connects

- V0.61 supports now also V.90 connect strings

- V0.70 is now Y2K safe together with the latest FAME Version

2.Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, copy the util wherever you want, I recommend to use C: as destination..

Then, create an Text-File containing the Following things:

----- CUT HERE -----

.key node
.bra <
.ket >

C:LASTCALLERS FAME:NODE<node>/CALLERS.LOG <node> 10 FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT <TELNET> <LOGFILE>

----- CUT HERE -----

Copy this file as LOGOFF.bat to your BBS:NODE(x)/NODEBATCHES/LOGOFFBATCHES/
directories and make sure to protect it with the +s command (Script-Bit!)

Before continueing the installation , I explain the Arguments known by
LastCallers...
                                       If you wish to have Telnet Support, set
                                       this Argument:------------|
SYNTAX:                                                          |

LASTCALLERS <CALLERSLOG> <NODENR.> <ANZ.USERS> <OUTPUT-BULL> <TELNET> <LOGFILE>
                                                                             |
                ^           ^           ^          ^                         |
This points to  |   Node    | Amount of |          |                         |
the Callerslog--|  Number---| users to  |          |--- Complete Pathname    |
of the desired                display---|               for the Output-Bull  |
node                                                                         |
                                                                             |
                                                                     Set this
                                                                     Arg. to
                                                                    create a
                                                                    logfile.


...so a valid call is :

Lastcallers FAME:NODE1/CALLERS.LOG 1 10 FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT


Will update the Storage-File from Node1/callers.log and creates the last 10
Callers bulletin in FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT

or

Lastcallers FAME:NODE1/CALLERS.LOG 1 10 FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT TELNET

Will update the Storage-File from Node1/callers.log and creates the last 10
Callers bulletin in FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT, but the Baudrate will be set to
INET to indicate the Telnet nodes (new for V0.57).

Lastcallers FAME:NODE1/CALLERS.LOG 1 10 FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT TELNET LOGFILE

Same like above example, but now LastCallers creates also a Logfile containing
Username, logintime, Onlinetime and Nodenumber, so the SysOp has a complete
overview of all calls recorded by LastCallers.

To display the Bulletin everytime a user logon, edit the LOGON.TXT File
located in the BBS:SCREENS/NODE(x)/ drawer and add the following:

----- CUT HERE -----
~
~SF_FAME:LASTCALLERS.TXT
----- CUT HERE -----

This will display the LastCallers.TXT everytime an user logs on....

That's all for the installation....

3.How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you first start the LastCaller-Util, it will search for a Datafile called
S:LC_DATABASE, this is the main Database used by LastCaller. If this datafile
doesn't exist, it will automatically generated by LastCaller. This Datafile
contains the actual informations like todays uploaded bytes etc, and the last
20 Callers...in the near future a second database will be generated, that
contains All records & DateStructs LastCaller has ever found & recorded...I'll
release this Struct, so other Door-Programers are able to write their own Bull-
Makers for this file..

Of course, the Sysop (User-Slot #1) won't be updated, coz it's not neccessary
to update his stats..:)

If you start LastCallers two times with the same callerslog and the same user,
LastCallers won't update again the database, as this user is already stored
and therefor an update is not neccessary (V0.59).

4.Da Greets..:)
