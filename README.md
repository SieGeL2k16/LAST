# Lastcallers utility for FAME BBS

These are the sources for my Lastcallers door made for FAME BBS systems.

Original description:

THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY USABLE IF YOU ARE RUNNING F.A.M.E. ! IT'S NOT
AMIEX - COMPATIBLE ! IF YOU USING AMIEX, PLEASE USE S-AMILOG BY
P0T-NOoDLE of ANTHROX, aS tHIS IS THE BEST LASTCALLER-UTIL EVER
WRITTEN FOR AMIEX & AND MOST OF THE DESIGN OF MY LASTCALLERS IS
TAKEN FROM S-AMILOG..:)


I've successfully compiled these sources with SAS/C 6.58 on my WinUAE system,
to compile just enter:

```
sc *.c PARMS=REGISTER NOSTKCHK SCODE SDATA STRIPDBG NOMINC NOICONS LINK
```

Please note that you need the FAME SDK installed to successfully compile this code!


Have fun,
